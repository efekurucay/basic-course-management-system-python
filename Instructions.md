Using a language of your choice we will manipulate a file that holds information for courses. The file has the following format separated by commas
-Course Department
-Course Code (number)
-Course Title
-Course AKTS

The operations you must implement are as follows:
-Get a list of courses in the file (just department and code concatenated)
-Add a new course (takes the parameters above in order)
-Removes a course (only takes the department and course code as parameters)
-Changes the AKTS for a course (takes department, course code, and new AKTS as parameters)
-Changes the course code (takes department, current course code, and new course code as parameters)


Provided are four files:
1. A java template for the operations.
2. A text file representing an example set of data
3. A java file for how we might call these operations (the console output is for this example is pasted below)
4. A second text file showing how the file would be changed (note, the file name is different from first text file, but for your solution, the two text files must be the same)

Example console output:
CSE101T
CSE101L
CSE204
